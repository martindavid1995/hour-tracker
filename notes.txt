Make changes on master.
Commit all main commits to master branch.

git status //show current branch
git switch master //make sure on master
**change code**
git add . //add all changes to staging area
git commit -m "msg" //commit LOCALLY
git push //push commit to remote


Want to try something you might want to revert? create a new branch and make changes on there

When you want to put it online, merge into gh-pages
git switch gh-pages //sit on gh-pages branch
git merge master //merge from master into gh-pages
git add . //stage the new changes from master
git commit -m "syncing gh-pages" //commit the changes to the gh-pages branch
git push gh-pages //push gh-pages to remote
